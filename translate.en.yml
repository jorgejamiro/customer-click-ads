title: <h2 align='center'>Predicting Customer's click on Ads</h2>
intro_1: Analyzing customer's behavior when it comes to **clicking** Ads on social media.
intro_2: Our goal is to predict what kind of customer will or won't click on the Ad.
title_graph_1: Customer clicked or didn't click based on Time spent on site and Salary
Time Spent on Site: Time Spent on Site
Salary: Salary
Count: Count
comment_graph_1: As we can see from this graph, there's a straight relationship between the salary and the time the customer spends on site and whether this customer ends up clicking or not eventually.
cs: Click vs. Salary
ctss: Click vs. Time Spent on Site
title_graph_2_1: Click vs. Salary
title_graph_2_2: Click vs. Time Spent on Site
comment_graph_2: Using Boxplot we can endorse clearly our aforementioned statement.
Histogram of Salary: Histogram of Salary
Histogram of Time Spent on Site: Histogram of Time Spent on Site
comment_1_graph_3: In this case, 'count' represents the number of customers.
comment_2_graph_3: These histograms help us to see customers' distribution regarding to their salary or to their time spent on site.

comment_last_1: Predictions were made using a *Logistic Regression* model (along with a previous data normalization). In order to train the model, data was divided into two subsets => **20%** for **testing** and **80%** for **training**.
comment_last_2: For instance, according to the outcome on **Test data**, we can verify that the **CM** gives us a number of **5 wrong predictions** when trying to predict **'non-clicking'** customers. We can observe this result on the right figure, where the colored backgroud represents the **actual data** vs. the dots representing **predictions**: **0 ('will NOT click')** and **1 ('will click')**.
